## Development Notes

- This project was completed in approximately 3 hours.
- The implementation leverages the shadcn/ui component library, which is great because it provides components that are directly in your codebase rather than hidden in node_modules, which means they can be customized easily. Also they are best in class in accessibility and provide a solid foundation for building a consistent UI.
